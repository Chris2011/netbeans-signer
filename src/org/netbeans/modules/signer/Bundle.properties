    Version 2.0.1<br/><br/>\n\n1. \
    All windows have been made resizable, as a workaround for font size issues with retina systems (thanks to AngeloD for reporting this)<br/><br/>\n\nVersion 2.0<br/><br/>\n\n1. \
    Enhanced GUI: Added functionality to create keystores.\
    <br/>\n2. \
    Now the signer asks for both module and existing keystore directories.\
    <br/>\n3. \
    You can see both module and keystore paths by hovering over their respective text fields. \
    That action displays a tooltip with that piece of information.\
    <br/>\n4. \
    It validates if the module directory field really contains a Netbeans Module project (it checks all the required files and basic properties used by a Netbeans Module)<br/><br/>\n\n<div style="color: red;">WARNINGS!!\
    </div><br/>\n*  It is your responsability to assign a valid keystore (if you already have one) and provide the right data (alias and password) to sign your modules. \
    Netbeans already validates that. \
    Therefore, this module will <b>NEVER</b> do it.\
    <br/>\n* Module directory validation may not have 100% accuracy, since the checked properties and files can be shared by or added to other project types. \
    My advice: use your common sense and select directories which contain a Netbeans Module.\
    <br/>\n* According to <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqSignNbm">signing process documentation</a>,  keystore and key password needs to be the same.\n\
    <br/><br/>\n\nVersion 1.1.1<br/><br/>\n\n* Minor BUG-FIX: It installs successfully but Netbeans says that it is inactive. \
    Solved by activating "Needs restart on install" (Thanks to Michael Mellinger and Jiri Kovalsky for reporting It)<br/><br/>\n\nVersion 1.1<br/><br/>\n\n1. \
    Dialog is not Modal anymore.\
    <br/>\n2. \
    Fixed a layout bug (The textboxes weren't shown properly. \
    They appeared very "shrunken")<br/>\n3. \
    The module now accepts any type of file as keystore file.
